 thus, planning to search via serp
  search query: <company-domain> revenue "zoominfo"
  check if the serp response contains the required information. if it does, get it from there itself
 required information

  naics code
  revenue
  website
 demo:

  this was the first query result on serp with the query: broadhorizon.com revenue "zoominfo"
